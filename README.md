# Master Pelham

This is a learning exercise into the use of long short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNN) as part of a Tensorflow course at Kadenze.com.

## Technologies

- Tensorflow
- Python

## Data

Public domain P.G. Wodehouse books comprising 1.9MB of somewhat cleaned up data.

## What does it do?

The network tries to guess the next character in the sequence, i.e. after taught it "remembers" the taught text and is able to compose new text on the basis of it.

## How?

T.B.C.
